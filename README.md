A Flights Analysis
==================

This is a project that will eventually make its way to the 
[RenkuLab platform](https://renkulab.io).

If you've never used renku, you can read about it in the 
[documentation](https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
You can also try out the [first steps tutorial](https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/01_firststeps.html)
to test drive some of the features.

If you run into any usability or conceptual issues or need help
setting up an instance for your institution, feel free to ask the 
renku team on https://renku.discourse.group/.

Definitely also let the team know if there seems to be a topic missing
from the documentation, or features you'd be interested in!
